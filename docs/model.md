# Data Models
###This area documents the JSON data models which are produced by the library; each section is detailed in its own file.  Unsupported Sections are optional elements which aren't currently implemented.  Please feel free to issue a pull request for support of these sections (so long as it has tests).

###Note:  JSON doesn't currently have a standard schema language; consequently these models are written to be used in a [Mongoose.js]("http://www.mongoosejs.com") compatible schema.
